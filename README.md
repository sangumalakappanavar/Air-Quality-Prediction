# Air-Quality-Prediction
This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various machine learning models based on pollutant levels. The application takes user input for pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3, and outputs AQI predictions from multiple trained regression models.
